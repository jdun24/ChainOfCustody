# ChainOfCustody
1. Goals:
The Chain of Custody is a critical part of the procedure for handling digital evidence. Digital evidence is any digital data that contains trustworthy information that supports an even hypothesis. The Chain of Custody serves the purpose of maintaining the evidence and protecting it from being tampered with. At this point in time, the uncertainty of the digital evidence has not been assessed. There has yet to be something that solves the trustworthiness of the Chain of Custody. This article is proposing to employ fuzzy hashing to ensure the integrity of the digital evidence. Essentially, fuzzy hashing would be employed within the blockchain data structure to handle the uncertainty that comes with dealing with the Chain of Custody documents. Traditional hashing is comparing the files to see if they are the exact same or not, which isn’t ideal in situations where the files can be modified benignly. Fuzzy hashing on the other end works by determining how different the two files are. This is shown to be useful in several instances.
2. Problems to Solve:
There are quite a bit of issues that one can run into when trying to implement a blockchain system. A problem that one could run into, would be that with conventionally hashing the data integrity can’t be guaranteed. This is because digital data can be readily altered. Conventional hashing also does not calculate the similarities between files nor does it serve to identify traces of evidence. These issues would be resolved by going with the fuzzy hashing method instead.
There are things to consider when creating a CoC system, since these can become issues with the system itself. There will always be threats to the data integrity
 throughout its lifetime. There is a huge amount of data that is being produced and ensuring the authenticity and integrity of all that data can be an issue. Digital evidence may be inadvertently altered after it has been acquired and this proposes an issue because it needs to still be admissible in court. The documentation of the CoC needs to be secure because the evidence should be protected and not be allowed to be copied or transferred to another system. The CoC also needs to be adaptable and should allow for a change in capacity because of the growing amount of data being produced by new forensics technologies.
In order to implement a CoC system that would take into account all of the issues listed above we would require the blockchain. The blockchain would come into play by being able to verify the validity and the legality of the processes used to collect, store, and transmit digital evidence. The blockchain will also be used to keep track of all the interactions done by clients with the evidence and other clients. The involvement of the blockchain in the CoC system would cover basically all of the verification and management of the data.
Image forgery is a very prevalent issue that cannot be fully resolved by the conventional blockchain. The conventional block chain only tells you if an image is the exact same image that it is being compared to. Image forgery leads us to knowing that all digital evidence has some form of uncertainty. This uncertainty needs to be taken into account when dealing with evidence because if it isn’t taken into account then the analysis on the evidence could lead to arriving at the wrong conclusion.
3. Methodologies:
In order to effectively apply fuzzy hashing in tandem with blockchain technology, the research team proposes the following framework of digital evidence access, storage, and authentication to maximize the integrity of the chain of custody. For the sake of this system’s research, the team has chosen to focus solely on images as the medium of evidence. This decision was made largely due to the relevance of image modification in real world crime investigations, as well the degree to which modern technology is able to manipulate and counterfeit digital imagery.

 First and foremost, it is necessary that only authorized parties are allowed to gather evidence and register it within the blockchain. These participants consist of individuals closely tied to the investigation, like police, lawyers, defense, and members of the court. As used in most permissioned networks of this sort, the blockchain will operate within the Proof of Authority consensus type. There are then two primary considerations of the manner in which data is accessed by these members: the front end and the evidence log. The front end acts as a means of downloading and certifying digital evidence. Each queried piece of data is hashed as a means of preservation of uniqueness and overall maintenance of the data pool. The purpose of the evidence log is to keep a record of activity and accountability regarding the front end. Each user interaction is logged in a peer to peer network including each of the authorized parties. Items like evidence descriptions, submitter ID, ownership history, and transfer of ownership are logged.
The application of a blockchain in storing sensitive evidence plays a significant role in ensuring data security and authenticity. When a piece of digital evidence is logged, it is hashed and stored on the blockchain, including key points like incident date, location of discovery, and state of evidence condition. Due to the limited size of authorized peers connected to the network, the given block size is relatively small. A key distinction of this framework is the application of piecewise hashing with blockchain technology. Since the chain of custody opens the doors for uncertainty, a mere pass or fail system of hashing may yield losses to valid evidence. Instead, piecewise hashing generates hashes for fixed segments of a file as opposed to the entire file at once. Fuzzy hashing, which combines the concepts of piecewise and rolling hashes, is applied here to measure data similarity rather than straight equivalence, as well as to preserve authenticity by minimizing imaging mistakes.
When gauging the similarity between multiple digital items, the concept of approximate matching (a form of fuzzy hashing) is applied. In this specific framework, the ideal form of matching is known as semantic matching. This is due to the fact that semantic matching pertains to similarity on the level of visual contents instead of byte-wise makeup. So, where a byte-wise comparison would fail to associate two identical images with different file types, a semantic check can process a PNG against a

 JPEG and determine their equivalence by appearance. Using the approximation algorithm known as MRSH-V2, this framework produces a similarity score between 0 and 100 for each comparison, considering 95 and above to be grounds for acceptable resemblance.
Another significant portion of the proposed framework lies within the usage of Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). HLF is a system through which digital items can be exchanged between different organizations. Hyperledger Composer (HLC) is an open source framework layered on top of the HLF that allows for more efficient use case design, significantly speeding up the design process. With these two technologies together, the proposed system experiences a series of advantages pertaining to the permissioned nature of the blockchain. This includes the fact that it is far more predictable and regulated, far less demanding in resources compared to more permissionless systems, and heavily modular, allowing for a greater number of method applications for reaching agreements between participants. The defining concepts of the business process for the HLF and HLC system are identified as assets, collaborators, and transactions. Assets refer to any item of interest that can be shared over a network. In this scenario, digital objects are assets that are held within the HLC’s registry. Collaborators are the participants of the forensic investigation. These individuals are logged within an identity registry of the HLC, which then supplies a channel for exchanging information amongst themselves. Transactions, then, store information regarding collaborator interaction with stored assets in the system. This produces the linkage between digital evidence and the actions upon them, tying the framework together.
The final piece of the proposed system is a separate database for storing digital evidence itself. The evidence is stored within the database alongside an identification number yielded from its hash. There are two primary reasons for supplementing the blockchain based evidence log with a separate evidence database. The first is that the digital items of interest may be too large to fit within the blockchain. The second, and most important for that matter, is the fact that items kept on the blockchain are made accessible to all nodes present in the network of the blockchain. This gives the opportunity to otherwise unauthorized nodes to access sensitive evidence within the

 chain. Instead, integrity is improved significantly by storing only the chain of custody process and corresponding hash values on the blockchain itself.
4. Evaluation:
This section presents the analysis on the blockchain-based solution for digital evidence management. The proposed system utilizes the Hyperledger Fabric framework and consists of three main components: evidence creation, evidence transfer, and evidence storage. The authors detail the functionality and design of each component, including the roles of different entities involved in the process. They also explain how the proposed system addresses some of the challenges associated with traditional evidence management systems, such as evidence tampering, chain of custody issues, and lack of transparency.
To assess the performance of the prototype, the authors conducted four sets of experiments using Hyperledger Caliper. The first set of experiments aimed to evaluate the transactional efficiency of the framework and involved testing the prototype's throughput and latency using different transaction volumes and send transaction rates. The results showed that the prototype's throughput achieved a maximum value and then began to decrease as the transmit rate increased. The highest throughputs obtained in 2-organization-1-peer and 3-organization-1-peer network architectures were 15 tps and 10 tps, respectively. Increasing the number of peers reduced the prototype's throughput, which is consistent with the characteristics of Hyperledger-based consortium blockchains.
The second set of experiments evaluated the load distribution of the block generator, which determines the distribution of blocks generated by each node in the blockchain network. The results showed that the load distribution was more evenly balanced with an increase in the number of node names.
The third set of experiments evaluated the blockchain's size against different numbers of blocks on a topology with 1000 nodes. The results showed that the

 blockchain's size grew linearly as the number of blocks increased, which is consistent with theoretical theory.
Finally, the last set of experiments aimed to determine the time required to conduct a full search and compared the proposed approach's success in locating illegal files to the MRSH-v2 approach. The results showed that the proposed approach was successful in locating the 100 "illegal" files included verbatim in the hard disk image, as well as the 40 files from the image that were similar to "illegal" files, as defined by MRSH-v2.
Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential of blockchain technology in improving digital evidence management and addresses some of the challenges associated with traditional evidence management systems. The performance evaluation results also provide insights into the limitations and characteristics of the proposed framework, which can inform further development and optimization.
5. Conclusion:
This paper explored new ways to implement a Chain of Custody(COC) for digital evidence by using fuzzy hashing algorithms to provide more flexibility than traditional methods which typically only tell you if two files are identical. These new fuzzy hash algorithms are used to provide an accurate measurement of just how similar two files are while keeping the legitimacy and integrity of the COC . This measurement is a scale between 0 and 100 which determines the amount of changes between the original file and the current file. This is combined with the blockchain gives you a precise record of when, how and if the file has been changed while providing ways for this chain to be shared with other reputable peers. The natural next step for this framework is to test its speed with a large amount of digital evidence, to determine whether or not it is viable for real world application.
